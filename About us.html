  <h1>Learn more about us</h1>

  <p>Life can be very difficult. The everyday stressors of life can be overwhelming. Unfortunately, people encounter so much more than just these everyday stressors: trauma, violence, loss, discrimination, transphobia and homophobia, to name a few, complicates our experience of being human.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>I tend to think that there's something magical in becoming curious about the human condition. My passion for psychology was born from this curiosity. I remember volunteering at an orphanage, many years ago, and witnessing the impact of trauma on young children. Trauma that is embedded in the fabric of South Africa's history. I was left questioning: 'How can people make sense of themselves, others and the world around them within such debilitating contexts?'</p>
